The project contains an implementation of an autocompletion feature.
The project will fetch data from a mock json of people by their names and complete the rest of matching people after having typed a character. 
Settings and features:
- mock list in json format consists of 1000 people, including f.ex their id, name, surname, email etc.
- while typing, the list of people is filtered in order to match the typed characters
- searching is case-insensitive
- the displayed number of propositions is limited to 8
- there can be multiple names, that's why when hovered over, a surname is added to display
